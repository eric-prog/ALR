# ALR - üìΩÔ∏è Autonomous Lecture Recorder 

Recorded lectures serve as invaluable learning resources for university students. As of today, the mere positioning of a camera at the back of a hall to capture the entire board falls short of delivering an optimal viewing experience of the recorded lectures, since deciphering the professor's writing can be a challenge. Thus, what holds the potential to be an exceptional educational tool instead morphs into a source of frustration and ineffectiveness for learners. <br>

The Autonomous Lecture Recorder (ALR), can be placed in the front row, thus removing the need to zoom in and increasing video quality.

### üåä Get Started

1. Clone the repo on your Raspberry Pi:
```
git clone https://github.com/eric-prog/ALR.git
```

2. Run the [setup.py](https://github.com/eric-prog/ALR/blob/main/setup.py) file in [Geany](https://raspberrytips.com/use-geany-on-raspberry-pi/) to install all dependencies!
> **_NOTE:_**  After installation may need to reboot/restart the Raspberry Pi

3. Open the [detect.py](https://github.com/eric-prog/ALR/blob/main/detect.py) using [Geany](https://raspberrytips.com/use-geany-on-raspberry-pi/) and run!
